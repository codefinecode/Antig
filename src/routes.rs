//! The route table: every way a gate host can be reached, what each was last
//! measured at, what each has *proved*, and the order the proxy should try them
//! in.
//!
//! Why a table and not a ladder. The proxy used to try its routes in a fixed
//! order - own proxy, built-in exit, relay, direct - and the order was a guess
//! about speed that the measurements then contradicted: the direct tunnel to a
//! substituted address answered in 0.28 s while the relay it sat *below* took
//! 0.40-0.80 s (kb/rivals.md Fact 3). A DNS race is not a speed measurement and
//! neither is a list, so every route is timed on the warm loop with the same
//! request.
//!
//! Speed is not the question that matters, though, and since 2.14.0_1 it is
//! only the tie-break. A probe cannot see the region gate - the refusal arrives
//! inside the client's own TLS and an unauthenticated call is answered 401 from
//! every exit alike (kb/dns.md) - so the fastest route can be the one Google
//! refuses, every time. What *can* see the gate is the client's own log: a
//! model answer writes `streamGenerateContent … ResponseID:` and a refusal
//! writes `User location is not supported` (`ls_log`). Each is attributed to the
//! route that carried it, and the order is:
//!
//! 1. the user's own proxy, whenever it is usable - they typed it in;
//! 2. routes that carried a model answer since their last refusal, fastest
//!    first - proof beats speed;
//! 3. the rest by measured speed, then unmeasured in the default order;
//! 4. routes that carried a refusal, last, for a penalty that grows each time
//!    the same route is refused again without a success in between.
//!
//! What the table has learned is about *this network*: a route refused from
//! behind one VPN may be exactly right without it. The relay hands the table a
//! fingerprint of the network (`set_context`), and a new one wipes the evidence
//! while keeping the timings.
//!
//! A route that carried a refusal also has its open gate tunnels closed at once
//! (D26). Every request on them is refused anyway, and a client that keeps its
//! pooled connection would otherwise go on being refused for another minute and
//! a half after the table has already switched - which is exactly what "send
//! the message again" ran into.
